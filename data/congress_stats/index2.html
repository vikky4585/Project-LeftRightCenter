<h1> Personality Traits of Congress: Overall, Demcrats and of Republicans</h1>
<p> Overall, Democrats and Republicans scored similarily on personality traits, and there were several
  characteristics shared by both parties.  In general, there are more differences within the parties than between them.
  However, there were differences between the two parties: </p>
  <li> In general, Democrats exhibited more negative traits on their twitter feeds.  We hypthesize that this may be due to being the 'out of power' part</li>
  <li> In this analysis, we used raw scores as opposed to percentiles, as the raw scores give a better represenation of true differences
  between groups. In the charts below, these differences roughly correlate with a 10% - 20% difference between groups</li>
