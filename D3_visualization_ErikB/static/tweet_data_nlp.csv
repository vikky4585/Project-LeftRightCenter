142,RepDonBeyer9,democrats,George HW Bush served his country with courage and honor in wartime and peacetime and his passing is a loss to the nation.Our prayers and condolences go out to all of the Bush family..Last week the Trump Administration tried to hide the findings of government scientists warning of the dangers of climate change in TWO reports.We rightly focused on the National Climate Assessment but the public lands report is very very important. ClimateFriday..NRDems leader RepRaulGrijalva said Zinke abused the public trust damaged the Interior Department is the target of an investigation just referred to the Justice Department one of 17 probes of ZinkeInteriorZinke responded with personal insults.He didnt deny a thing..The Atlantic Seismic Airgun Protection Act would stop these blasting permits in the Atlantic.This bill is ready to go and it has wide bipartisan support from Members representing nearly every Atlantic seaboard state.We should pass it ASAP.99.It is important that the incoming Democratic majority take steps to address climate change by crafting legislation.Thats something Ive worked on for years.But we also have to step up oversight and use our majority to fight Trumps backwards steps that put lives at risk.8.The Trump Administration knows that climate change is killing people and costing huge amounts of money.But with this step today as with their decision to roll back the Clean Power Plan and other efforts to fight climate change they are instead actively making it worse.7.The Trump Administration also quietly tried to bury findings by the US Geological Survey showing exploitation of federal lands including offshore drilling made up nearly 14 of all US greenhouse gas emissions from 20052014.This is a big deal.6.A week ago the National Climate Assessment made it clear that climate change is killing Americans and costing billions of dollars.Trump and his Cabinet have spent the week engaging in willful ignorance of scientific findings and now they are pushing more dirty energy.5.Even in a time of economic hardship the risks posed by Trumps actions would outweigh the benefits.There is absolutely no justification for intentionally welcoming this kind of damage at a time when oil prices are low and fossil fuel corporations are posting record profits.4.These are just some of the reasons why coastal states communities small businesses political leaders from both parties and the United States Navy all stand united in opposition to drilling seismic blasting and invasive petroleum exploration in the Atlantic Ocean.3.Seismic blasting poses a major threat to marine life including the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale which is on the verge of extinction.The potential for harm to marine life from blasting and drilling also poses a serious danger to the coastal economies.2.Since Donald Trump has decided to ignore the concerns of residents and stakeholders directly impacted by seismic blasting and offshore drilling it is time for Congress to step in and put a stop to this by passing my bill the Atlantic Seismic Airgun Protection Act.1.As of 2017 3.9 million children do not have health insurance.Since Trump has taken office the number of uninsured kids has increased in every state across the country.If you need insurance go to  to GetCovered by December 15.CaucusOnClimate Just so we have it straight EPAAWheeler is willing to disparage a report he admits he hasnt read AND will take cred.Earlier this year the House took an big step in the fight to EndAIDS by reauthorizing PEPFAR.This a huge victory for global health  made possible through hard work on both sides of the aisle.Together we can save lives.WorldAIDSDay.NancyPelosi.HouseDemocrats newlyelected leadership team is ready to fight ForThePeople in the 116th Congress.Good newsVirginia is on pace to help 375000 people get covered through Medicaid expansion This smashes the estimates made by state officials earlier this year..Thank you to everyone who was able to participate in tonights telephone town hall I love hearing from my constituents and will continue to look to your perspectives as we head into the 116th Congress with a Democratic majority.Congratulations RepRaskin.At every step Trump tried to sabotage the Affordable Care Act and weaken our healthcare system hoping the American people wouldnt understand who was responsible.This month that backfired but Trump is continuing to disregard the countrys desire for better health care..HouseDemocrats Congratulations to the new cochairs of the DPCC RepTedLieu RepCartwright and RepDebDingell.
